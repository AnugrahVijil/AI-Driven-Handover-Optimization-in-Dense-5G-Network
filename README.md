# AI-Driven-Handover-Optimization-in-Dense-5G-Network
This project uses machine learning and reinforcement learning to improve 5G handover decisions. Implemented in both Kaggle (Python) and MATLAB, it analyzes handover outcomes, trains a DQN agent, and validates results using confusion matrix, correlation heatmap, reward progression, and outcome distributions.
